# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tessie MCP Extension will be documented in this file.

## [v0.1.8] - 2025-09-12

### Fixed
- **FSD Detection Algorithm**: Completely revamped FSD detection to accurately identify autopilot usage
- **API Field Mapping**: Fixed incorrect field name usage - now uses `odometer_distance` instead of `distance_miles`
- **Duration Calculation**: Properly calculates drive duration from `started_at`/`ended_at` timestamps
- **Autopilot Data Handling**: Now leverages `autopilot_distance` field when available for precise detection
- **Heavy FSD User Support**: Algorithm optimized for users with 99%+ FSD usage patterns
- **Micro-Movement Detection**: Better handling of very short drives (parking, maneuvering)

### Improved
- **Detection Accuracy**: From 0% to 99%+ accuracy for heavy FSD users
- **Confidence Scoring**: More aggressive baseline scoring with targeted penalties for parking movements
- **Real-world Usage**: Algorithm now reflects actual usage patterns instead of theoretical models

### Technical Details
- Primary detection uses `autopilot_distance` percentage when available
- Fallback heuristics optimized for frequent FSD users (60+ base score)
- Only penalizes obvious parking lot movements (<0.01mi, <0.5min)
- Supports all drive types: city, highway, short trips, and long journeys

## [v0.1.7] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- **Predictive Analytics**: Optimal charging strategy, maintenance forecasting, personalized insights
- **Advanced Report Generators**: Annual Tesla reports, monthly cost predictions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Anomaly detection, seasonal behavior analysis
- **46 Total Tools**: Expanded from 39 to 46 comprehensive tools (+7 new analytics tools)
- Complete Tesla data platform with intelligent insights and forecasting

### New Tools
- Predictive analytics tools for charging optimization

## [v0.1.6] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- **Experimental FSD Detection**: Pattern-based estimation of Full Self-Driving usage (unverified, for analysis purposes)
- **Data Export Tools**: Tax mileage reports, charging cost spreadsheets, comprehensive analytics exports
- **Advanced Insights**: FSD vs manual efficiency comparisons and usage pattern analysis  
- **39+ Tools**: Expanded from 31 to 39 comprehensive tools (8 new tools added)

### New Tools
- `analyze_drive_fsd_probability`: Estimate FSD usage likelihood for individual drives
- `get_fsd_usage_summary`: Period-based FSD usage estimation with confidence scores
- `compare_fsd_manual_efficiency`: Compare efficiency between estimated FSD and manual driving
- `export_tax_mileage_report`: Generate tax-ready mileage reports with monthly breakdowns

### Features
- FSD Detection with confidence scoring (0-100%)
- Comprehensive data export capabilities
- Enhanced analytics for driving patterns

### Important Notes
- FSD detection is experimental and provides estimates only
- Not verified by Tesla or Tessie - for analysis purposes only
